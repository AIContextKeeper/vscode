# Extension Icon Needed

The extension needs a 128x128 PNG icon saved as `icon.png` in the root directory.

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- A brain or thought bubble icon representing AI conversations
- A folder or file icon with AI/chat symbols
- A combination of code brackets and chat bubble
- Colors should match ContextKeeper branding

## Placeholder:
For now, remove the icon reference from package.json or create a simple colored square until a proper icon is designed.
